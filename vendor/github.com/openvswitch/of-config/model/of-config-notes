This file contains notes regarding some nodes in
the of-config model, which are used differently
compared to how the model describes them.


/capable-switch/logical-switches/switch/resources/certificate

In configuration modification these nodes are
ignored. Once the user sets /capable-switch/
/resources/(owned and external)-certificate,
these are automatically used by every logical-
-switch defined. get-config operation retrieves
the correct and actual configuration.
